"""TF_GLM_HC_SPLIT=1: a prompt chunk's hyper-connection glue split by rows between the two ranks (decode untouched).

Unsplit, each exchange site (after the attention block and after the MLP/MoE block) all-gathers both ranks' fp32
partials [R, D], and both ranks run hc_post and the next hc_pre over all R rows. Split, rank r owns rows
[r H, r H + H) (H = R / 2; an odd chunk gets one zero pad row, which nothing reads): each rank sends the peer its
partial of the peer's rows (fp32), adds the two partials of its own rows rank 0's first (``glue.hc_post_pair``, the
same kernel as hc_post), runs hc_post and the next hc_pre on its own rows, and swaps its normed rows (bf16) for the
peer's, so both ranks hold the next block's full input. The residual streams (b.x) stay current for own rows only;
DFlash2 taps and the final stream mean (b.hidden) are computed on own rows and swapped like the normed rows. Every
glue kernel is row-independent and the partial sum order is unchanged, so every bit is the unsplit path's.

The group sums b.xs of the normed rows are not swapped: no prompt-chunk matmul reads them (4-bit projections of a
prompt chunk run ``prefill_matmul``, BF16 and FP8 ones ignore them). The tests compare split and unsplit states bit
for bit, so a later reader would show up there.

TF_GLM_PREFILL_OVERLAP=1 (with the split) runs the swaps on a second CUDA stream in row pieces: a site computes the
peer's rows of its partial first, piece by piece, each piece's swap starting as it is done, then its own rows; then
the glue piece by piece, each piece waiting only for its own partial rows and its normed rows swapped while the next
piece's glue runs. Events order the two streams; the arithmetic is the same kernels on the same rows.

TF_GLM_PREFILL_OVERLAP=2 also runs the next block's row-independent front (``glue``'s ``front``: KDA's input
projections, DSA's projections, norms and query expansion, the dense MLP's gate/up, the shared expert of the MoE) on
this rank's rows of each piece right after that piece's glue, while its normed rows (and the later pieces' partials)
are still on the wire; the block then runs its front on the peer's rows once they have arrived, and the rest as
before. Without it the main stream waited for the last piece's swap with nothing to do. The fronts are row-independent
kernels (the prompt matmul gives every row range the same bits), so every bit is still the unsplit path's.

TF_GLM_HC_EXCHANGE: ``p2p`` (the default) swaps rows with ncclSend/ncclRecv; ``gather`` uses the NCCL all-gather
instead (whole halves, one piece: the partial halves out of place into the unused all-gather buffer, the bf16 rows in
place), the same bytes on the wire, for when NCCL's point-to-point path is slower or misbehaves on a fabric."""
