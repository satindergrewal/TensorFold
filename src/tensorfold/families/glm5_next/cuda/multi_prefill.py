"""TF_GLM_MULTI_PREFILL=1 (--parallel): one prompt chunk holds the next rows of several waiting prompts, each prompt's
rows getting the bits they get in a chunk of their own.

Without it, concurrent requests' prompts are prefilled one stream at a time (``multi.MultiDecoder``: the oldest
filling stream's chunk, then a decode round, then the next chunk ...), so the last of four short prompts that arrive
together waits for eight forwards (a 130-token prompt is two chunks: up to its 64-token grid point, where its state
is kept, then its tail) and the decode rounds between them. A forward's cost is mostly fixed at short lengths (~0.12 s
on two Sparks, the weights read once a layer whatever the rows), so a chunk of all four prompts costs little more than
one of them.

A multi-prompt chunk lays its pieces back to back ([s1 rows][s2 rows]...), as a batched verify window does, and runs
one forward over them on the prompt buffers (``Engine.pbuf``):

- the row-independent work runs once over every row: embedding, hyper-connection glue (split between the ranks,
  ``hcsplit``, by the chunk's rows), the blocks' fronts (KDA input projections; DSA projections, norms and query
  expansion), the output projections, the MoE router and routed experts (each pair one fp32 chain: one expert read
  for every prompt), the shared expert, the final norm. These are the kernels a prompt chunk already relies on to
  give a row the same bits whatever chunk it came in (``forward``'s module docstring, ``hcsplit``'s fronts);
- what reads or writes a stream's own state runs piece by piece on that stream's ``forward.State``, through the very
  calls a chunk of its own makes, with the piece's rows as a view of the buffers: the KDA recurrence, its state commit
  and conv shift (``forward.kda_rows``, the chunked or serial kernel at the stream's position), and DSA's latent
  write, indexer update, absorb, dense / sparse attention and expand (``forward.dsa_rows``, at the stream's position
  with its own extent, index ring and chunk count);
- after the forward, per piece in order: the head's logits of its last row when the piece ends its prompt (one row,
  as alone), its DFlash2 taps (its own context), its commit.

So a piece's bits are those of the same rows run as a chunk of their own, from the same position: a valid chunking of
its prompt (pieces start where its own chunks would, on the prompt grid, and end at its kept points or its end).

Image prompts (rows replaced by the vision tower's output) and replays of a kept prompt's head are not grouped; they
fill alone as before. The latent cache is required (``latent.ENABLED``, the default)."""
